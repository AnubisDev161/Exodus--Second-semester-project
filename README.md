# Exodus--Second-semester-project
Exodus is a tactical escort shooter where you protect a convoy of civilians from an invisible demonic threat. Switch between normal vision — fast but blind — and a slowed demonic state that reveals enemies and arms you for the fight. Stay sharp. Stay close. Keep them alive.

Exodus was developed as a student project at the [S4G School for Games](https://www.school4games.net/) between June and August 2025.
