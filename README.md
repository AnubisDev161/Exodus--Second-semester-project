# Exodus-Second-semester-project
Exodus is a tactical escort shooter where you protect a convoy of civilians from an invisible demonic threat. Switch between normal vision — fast but blind — and a slowed demonic state that reveals enemies and arms you for the fight. Stay sharp. Stay close. Keep them alive.
